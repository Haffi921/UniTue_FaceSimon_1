    Dear Participant,<br /><br />
    
    Thank you for participating in a study of the Action Control Lab of the University of Tübingen!<br />

    With our research, we aim to gain a better understanding of human behavior and mental processes. For this purpose, we will assess several indicators of your behavior (e.g. evaluations, reaction times, etc.).<br /><br />
    Your participation in this study is <strong>voluntary</strong>. You may withdraw your consent to participate at any time without giving reasons.<br />
    As no personal data will be collected, <strong>your data and your person cannot be connected after data collection</strong> – the data set is <strong>anonymous</strong>. Respectively, deletion of your data will not be possible after data collection has been completed, as we cannot retrace your data set.
    The <strong>results and anonymized data collected in this study will be published as a scientific publication</strong>. This will happen in an anonymized format, so that no data can be traced back to a specific person. The completely <strong>anonymized data of this study will be made available to other researchers and/or on the internet </strong>via the data archive Open Science Framework (OSF). By doing so, this study follows the recommendations of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychologie (DGPS, German Psychological Society) regarding quality assurance in research.<br /><br />

    If you have any questions now or after the experiment, please contact:<br />
